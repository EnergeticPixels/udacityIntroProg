            <h3>Stage 0 Notes</h3>
            <p>HTML with &lt;b&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; tags
                <ul>
                    <li>the bold tag is designated for stressing textual (visual) elements on the screen. But recent standards advise to use the strong tag and then style that tag in css to get the desired visual result.</li>
                    <li>the paragraph tag is for designating paragraphs of text.  The visual result is something like printed material, but in our case it comes along with some 'automatic' styling for spacing between other elements around the paragraph.</li>
                    <li>The emphasis tag is for styling something that should be in italics or to give a textual element some other 'embossing'</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>HTML line-break tag
                <ul>
                    <li>The html element for line break is probably thought of as being a block element, but I have learned that it is thought of as being an inline element.  As crazy as that sounds.</li>
                </ul>
